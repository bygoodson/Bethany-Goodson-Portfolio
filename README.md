#### Assessment 7: Inventory Manager Continued and Grade Calculator
 - This assignment combined creativity, data visualization, and spreadsheet logic to build an Inventory Manager and Grade Calculator in Excel, completed as part of an in-class project. The goal was to deepen our understanding of formulas, formatting, and visual storytelling in spreadsheets. For Part 1, I built on my previous Inventory Manager with my side hustle called Bethany’s Books and added two fully labeled charts - one embedded directly in the worksheet and one on a separate sheet - to clearly communicate patterns in the inventory data to a non-technical audience. I used Excel’s built-in chart tools to visualize trends like purchase price vs selling price, which helped turn raw numbers into compelling stories. For Part 2, I created a personal Grade Calculator for one of my real college courses Foundations of Philosophy. I included assignment categories like reading notes, in-class tests, attendance preparation/participation, and final test/essay, each with corresponding weights based on their syllabi. Using Excel formulas and conditional logic, the calculator automatically computes both number grades and final letter grades, along with a pie chart to show the weight distribution. Some challenges I faced involved making the calculations dynamic and ensuring the pie chart annotations were clear, but I overcame them through trial, error, and testing. If I were to enhance this project, I’d consider adding GPA projections across multiple semesters and improving visual design for presentation readiness.

#### Assessment 11: Course Grade Evaluator
 - This project was an in-class assignment where I modified a Course Grade Evaluator program we had worked on previously to allow users to input custom weight percentages for quizzes and assessments, instead of using fixed values. The goal was to make the grade calculator more flexible and user-driven, solving the problem of hardcoded weight distributions which may not apply to every grading system. I used Python to code the program and implemented input validation to ensure the weights were numeric and added up to 100%. One of the main challenges was creating loops that correctly prompted users to re-enter data until it met the required conditions, which helped strengthen my understanding of input validation and while loops. I didn’t use any outside collaborators, but I referenced class materials and debugging techniques we learned to refine the program. The final result successfully calculates and displays quiz and assessment averages, both unweighted and weighted overall averages, and assigns a letter grade using conditional statements. If I had more time, I would improve the user interface and add the option to input an unlimited number of scores for more real-world use.

#### Assessment 12: Personality Test Application
 - This project was an assignment for my Making Sense of Data class, where the goal was to create a personality test application using Python. The problem I aimed to solve was to design a simple, accessible, and engaging test that categorizes users based on their responses to a series of questions. I used Python as the primary tool, employing functions, conditionals, loops, and error-handling mechanisms to ensure that users could only input valid responses. One of the challenges I faced was making sure the program didn’t crash due to invalid inputs, which required careful error handling. I also had to balance simplicity with functionality when categorizing personality types. While I worked independently, I consulted Python documentation and online programming forums for guidance. The result was a user-friendly application that successfully categorized users based on their answers, though I would improve the user interface and expand the test further if I had the opportunity to take this project to the next level.
